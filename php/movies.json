In 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the team, breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.

Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.

In LA filmmaker Rodney Ascher's ROOM 237, we hear from people who have developed far-reaching theories and believe they have decoded the hidden symbols and messages buried in the late director's film. Carefully examining The Shining inside out, and forwards and backwards, ROOM 237 is equal parts captivating, provocative and pure pleasure. It gives voice to the fans and scholars who espouse these theories, reworking the film to match their ideas and intercutting it with layers of dreamlike imagery to illustrate their streams of consciousness. Sometimes outrageous, always engaging, the words of the interviewees are given full force by Ascher's compelling vision. Also featured at the 2012 Sundance, Cannes and Toronto film festivals.

Simply a straight line through the center of the earth, since the two places are antipodes: they are located diametrically opposite to each other on the earth's surface. During his visits to four such antipodal pairs, the award-winning documentary filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky captured images that turn our view of the world upside down. A beautiful, peaceful sunset in Entre Ros is contrasted with the bustling streets in rainy Shanghai. People who live in a wasteland are connected to people dwelling next to a volcano. Landscapes whose splendor touches the soul are juxtaposed with the clamor of a vast city. These antipodes seem mythically connected, somehow united by their oppositeness.

Eli's mother is a drug addict, and his father is physically abusive. When police answer a domestic disturbance call at Eli's home on his 10th birthday, the young boy is placed in a youth facility where compliance takes precedence over compassion. Meanwhile, Ken Matthews is an investment banker with a bright future. In a calculated effort to dazzle his latest client, a wealthy heiress, Ken volunteers at a youth camp for at-risk children. There, he's paired with Eli. As the two settle into the cabin shared with compassionate counselor Samuel and his quirky charge Redford, it doesn't take long for Ken to realize that he's way out of his league. Eli sees right through Ken, and lashes out at him whenever possible. At first, Ken responds with frustration and anger. The more he learns about Eli's tragic past however, the more his heart goes out to him. In time Ken learns to love Eli unconditionally, a love that's soon challenged when the young boy's brutish father pays an unexpected visit to the camp. At that moment Eli's plight becomes real to Ken, prompting the once-neglectful counselor to do some serious soul searching, and make a sacrifice that could drastically alter the future of the boy who's stuck in a dangerous downward spiral. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http:\/\/content7.flixster.com\/movie\/11\/17\/01\/11170153_mob.jpg","profile":"http:\/\/content7.flixster.com\/movie\/11\/17\/01\/11170153_pro.jpg","detailed":"http:\/\/content7.flixster.com\/movie\/11\/17\/01\/11170153_det.jpg","original":"http:\/\/content7.flixster.com\/movie\/11\/17\/01\/11170153_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Michael Mattera","id":"771436535","characters":["Ken","Ken Matthews"]},{"name":"Miles Elliot","id":"771436533","characters":["Eli"]},{"name":"Asante Jones","id":"771278978","characters":["Samuel","Samuel Smith"]},{"name":"Michael Jacob Wayne","id":"771439363","characters":["Redford"]},{"name":"Grace Johnston","id":"770680671","characters":["Tammi","Tammie Parker"]}],"links":{"self":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771350030.json","alternate":"http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/camp_2013\/","cast":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771350030\/cast.json","clips":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771350030\/clips.json","reviews":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771350030\/reviews.json","similar":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771350030\/similar.json"},"genres":["Drama"]},{"id":"771315180","title":"The Gatekeepers","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":97,"critics_consensus":"Strikingly stark, brutally honest, and rivetingly assembled, The Gatekeepers offers essential perspective on a seemingly intractable war from some of the men who fought it.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-02-01"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":92,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":83},"synopsis":"Charged with overseeing Israel's war on terror-both Palestinian and Jewish- the head of the Shin Bet, Israel's secret service is present at the crossroad of every decision made.

And so it is that Saleem Sinai, the bastard child of a beggar woman, and Shiva, the only son of a wealthy couple, are fated to live the destinies meant for each other. Over the next three decades, Saleem and Shiva find themselves on opposite sides of many a conflict, whether it be because of class, politics, romantic rivalry, or the constantly shifting borders that are drawn every time neighbors become enemies and decide to split their newborn nation into two, and then three, warring countries.

Two teenage girls - GINGER & ROSA - are inseparable. They skip school together, talk about love, religion and politics and dream of lives bigger than their mothers' domesticity. But the growing threat of nuclear war casts a shadow over their lives. Ginger (Elle Fanning) is drawn to poetry and protest, while Rosa (Alice Englert) shows Ginger how to smoke cigarettes, kiss boys and pray. Both rebel against their mothers: Rosa's single mum, Anoushka (Jodhi May), and Ginger's frustrated painter mother, Natalie (Christina Hendricks). Meanwhile, Ginger's pacifist father, Roland (Alessandro Nivola) seems a romantic, bohemian figure to the girls. He encourages Ginger's 'Ban-the-Bomb' activism, while Rosa starts to take a very different interest in him. As Ginger's parents fight and fall apart, Ginger finds emotional sanctuary with a gay couple, both named Mark (Timothy Spall and Oliver Platt), and their American friend, the poet Bella (Annette Bening). Finally, as the Cuban Missile Crisis escalates - and it seems the world itself may come to an end - the lifelong friendship of the two girls is shattered. Ginger clutches at one hope; if she can help save the world from extinction, perhaps she too will survive this moment of personal devastation.

Set against the backdrop of the Egyptian pyramids, this ad would sell more vodka than Smirnoff had dreamed, transforming America into a martini-sipping country and launching Stern to star photographer status at the age of 25. Sought after by Madison Avenue, Hollywood, and the international fashion scene, Bert was at the heart of what creative director George Lois called \"the creative evolution.\" His groundbreaking images of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Marilyn Monroe, Twiggy and the infamous Lolita image from Kubrick's film, coupled with his astonishing success in advertising, minted Stern - along with Irving Penn and Richard Avedon - as a celebrity in his own right.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http:\/\/content8.flixster.com\/movie\/11\/17\/09\/11170938_mob.jpg","profile":"http:\/\/content8.flixster.com\/movie\/11\/17\/09\/11170938_pro.jpg","detailed":"http:\/\/content8.flixster.com\/movie\/11\/17\/09\/11170938_det.jpg","original":"http:\/\/content8.flixster.com\/movie\/11\/17\/09\/11170938_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Bert Stern","id":"546953271"},{"name":"Shannah Laumeister","id":"770717333"},{"name":"Larry Chilnick","id":"771442126"},{"name":"Judith Crist","id":"770962247"},{"name":"Albert d'Annibale","id":"771442127"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1223411"},"links":{"self":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771271510.json","alternate":"http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/bert_stern_original_madman\/","cast":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771271510\/cast.json","clips":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771271510\/clips.json","reviews":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771271510\/reviews.json","similar":"http:\/\/api.rottentomatoes.com\/api\/public\/v1.0\/movies\/771271510\/similar.json"},"genres":["Documentary","Special Interest"]},{"id":"771309897","title":"It's a Disaster","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":88,"critics_consensus":"A clever black comedy, It's a Disaster is sometimes uneven but the sharp writing and stellar ensemble cast keeps the film on track.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-04-12","dvd":"2013-06-04"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":76,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":71},"synopsis":"Eight friends meet for their monthly \"couples brunch.\" But what starts as an impromptu therapy session \/ airing of domestic grievances takes a sudden, catastrophic turn when the city falls victim to a mysterious attack.

Directors Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush examine this issue through the lens of three people for who are struggling with food insecurity: Barbie, a single Philadelphia mother who grew up in poverty and is trying to provide a better life for her two kids; Rosie, a Colorado second-grader who often has to depend on friends and neighbors to feed her and has trouble concentrating in school; and Tremonica, a Mississippi second-grader whose asthma and health issues are exacerbated by the largely empty calories her hardworking mother can afford. Their stories are interwoven with insights from experts including sociologist Janet Poppendieck, author Raj Patel and nutrition policy leader Marion Nestle; ordinary citizens like Pastor Bob Wilson and teachers Leslie Nichols and Odessa Cherry; and activists such as Witness to Hunger's Mariana Chilton, Top Chef's Tom Colicchio and Oscar (R)-winning actor Jeff Bridges. Ultimately, Finding North shows us how hunger poses serious economic, social and cultural implications for our nation, and that it could be solved once and for all, if the American public decides - as they have in the past - that making healthy food available and affordable is in the best interest of us all.

Still ferocious, charismatic, and hilariously blunt, the now 87-year-old Koch ruled New York from 1978 to 1989-a down-and-dirty decade of grit, graffiti, near-bankruptcy and rampant crime. First-time filmmaker (and former Wall Street Journal reporter) Neil Barsky has crafted an intimate and revealing portrait of this intensely private man, his legacy as a political titan, and the town he helped transform. The tumult of his three terms included a fiercely competitive 1977 election; an infamous 1980 transit strike; the burgeoning AIDS epidemic; landmark housing renewal initiatives; and an irreparable municipal corruption scandal. Through candid interviews and rare archival footage, Koch thrillingly chronicles the personal and political toll of running the world's most wondrous city in a time of upheaval and reinvention.

Alina cannot understand her friend's choice. In her attempt to win back Voichita's affection, she challenges the priest. She is taken to hospital and the people of the monastery start to suspect that she is possessed. When the doctors send her back, Alina is included in the monastic routine in the hope that she will find peace. But her condition worsens and they finally have to tie her to a wooden plank to prevent her from hurting herself.

He worked on the film for 10 years, watching and catching children's points of view with his camera and mixing in tightly edited flashbacks in which the spirits of human beings appear with an ultra-realistic and violent storyline.

For 35 years one American, Sidney Rittenberg witnessed and participated in these and other formative events as an insider. Arriving in China at the end of World War II as a GI interpreter, Rittenberg joined the Communist Party and became an active participant in the Party's leadership, including Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. Rittenberg gained prominence at the Chinese Broadcast Administration, the principal propaganda arm of the revolution and lectured around the country on Mao's behalf. But in the convulsions of an immense country constantly reinventing itself, Rittenberg twice ran afoul of the leadership, serving a total of 16 years in solitary confinement. Filmed over a 5-year period, Rittenberg's lucid and incisive description of events, his intimate knowledge of Mao's objectives, his own insights and his tenacious desire to be a part of history, make his life's story a central contribution to the history of the 20th Century.

Bringing us back and forth in time, Gregory looks not only at his life, but at the nature of art, love and the creative process.

From the outset, the purpose of their journey is unclear, and the motivations behind their heated altercations and shady errands are hazy, but sporadic moments of tenderness illuminate the loving bond between the two that exists underneath their overt tensions. As the couple travels up the Gulf Coast past an endless panorama of mangrove fields, trailer parks, and cookie-cutter housing developments, the disturbing details of their excursion gradually begin to emerge, revealing Crystal's sinister past and the couple's troubling future. Filmed on location in the environs of Seimetz's hometown of St. Petersburg, Florida, Sun Don't Shine is a subtly cryptic story driven by the powerful performances of its lead actors and its eerily poetic setting.
